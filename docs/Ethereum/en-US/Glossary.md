## Blockchain
> Block sequence verified by `Proof-of-work(PoW)` in the `Ethereum network`

## Proof-of-work(PoW)
> The Ethereum network began by using a `consensus mechanism` that involved `Proof-of-work (PoW)`. This allowed the nodes of the Ethereum network to agree on the state of all information recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and prevented certain kinds of economic attacks. However, Ethereum switched off `proof-of-work` in 2022 and started using `proof-of-stake` instead.

## consensus mechanism 
> The term 'consensus mechanism' is often used colloquially to refer to `'proof-of-stake'`, `'proof-of-work'` or `'proof-of-authority'` protocols. However, these are just components in consensus mechanisms that protect against `Sybil attacks`. Consensus mechanisms are the complete stack of ideas, protocols and incentives that enable a distributed set of nodes to agree on the state of a blockchain.

## Proof-of-stake(PoS)
> Proof-of-stake is a way to prove that validators have put something of value into the network that can be destroyed if they act dishonestly.
